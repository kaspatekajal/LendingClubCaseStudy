# Lending Club Case Study
  In this case study, we analyze loan data for the last 4 years to know what are the driving factors for the loan defaulters.

  We have followed Exploratory Data analysis techniques here to understand the data and make predications.

  Data cleaning
  Data understanding
  Univariate analysis
  Bivariate analysis
  Multivariate analysis
  Derived metrics if needed.

## General Information
Lending Club specializes in various types of loans to urban individual customers.
This case study is carried out for a financial institute to understand the factors driving "financial loss"
Financial Loss happens when the customer has defaulted to pay off the loan and the loan amount cannot be recovered from the customer.
Data used for this analysis comprises over 38000 loan applicants with over 100 attributes of the loan and the customers. Loans in this data set are issued from 2007 until 2011. This data set contains various important attributes like interest rates, loan amount, annual income of the customers, employment details of the customers, and so on.


## Conclusions
- Chances of default increases as the annual income decreases. Applicants with salary less than 30000 have defaulted the most
- Applicant has a sub-grade as F5 or G2 or G3 or G5
- Loan is for 'small_business' or 'car'
- Loan is for '60 months'
- Applicant is from states - Nebraska, Nevada, Arkansasa or South Dakota
